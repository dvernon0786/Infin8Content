  - `lib/services/outstand/caption-generator.ts` — AI caption generation via OpenRouter (gpt-4o-mini)
  - `lib/inngest/functions/publish-to-social.ts` — durable Inngest workers: `autoPublishToSocial` (event: `article/generation.completed`) + `manualPublishToSocial` (event: `article/publish.requested`)
  - `app/api/v1/articles/[id]/publish-social/route.ts` — manual publish trigger (POST, 202 Accepted)
  - `app/api/v1/articles/[id]/caption/route.ts` — AI caption preview (GET)
  - `app/api/v1/articles/[id]/social-analytics/route.ts` — analytics fetch (GET)
  - `app/api/v1/social/accounts/route.ts` — org social accounts list (GET)
  - `app/api/webhooks/outstand/route.ts` — webhook receiver (`post.published` / `post.error`), HMAC verified
- **Frontend (3 components)**
  - `components/articles/SocialPublishModal.tsx` — Dialog with caption editor, char counter, regenerate, account chips, publish CTA, success/error states
  - `components/articles/PublishToSocialButton.tsx` — self-contained trigger; shows "Published" badge post-publish
  - `components/articles/SocialAnalytics.tsx` — inline analytics card: aggregated metrics grid + per-account breakdown
- **Patched files**
  - `app/api/inngest/route.ts` — registered `autoPublishToSocial` + `manualPublishToSocial`
  - `lib/inngest/functions/generate-article.ts` — emits `article/generation.completed` in `complete-article` step
  - `app/dashboard/articles/[id]/page.tsx` — added `cms_status`/`slug` to select; injected `<PublishToSocialButton>` + `<SocialAnalytics>` after `<PublishHistory>`
- **TypeScript:** `tsc --noEmit` exits 0 (zero errors)
- **Pending (manual):** Apply DB migration, set `OUTSTAND_API_KEY` + `OUTSTAND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, register webhook URL in Outstand dashboard, seed `org_social_accounts` via `scripts/generate-social-seed.mjs`

## Key Achievements

✅ 9-step workflow LOCKED  
✅ 5 hard gates enforced  
✅ 9 feature flags designed  
✅ BMAD-clean design (13/13)  
✅ Complete execution plan  
✅ Zero ambiguity  
✅ Ready for engineering  

---

## Architecture Locked

- ICP mandatory and first
- Keywords URL-driven
- All 4 DataForSEO methods required
- Subtopics are articles (immutable)
- Human approval before generation
- Agents run after approval
- Legacy system preserved
- No rewrites or deletions

---

## 6-Week Timeline

```
Week 1: Foundation (LOW RISK)
Week 2: ICP + Competitors (MEDIUM)
Week 3-4: Keyword Engine (HIGH)
Week 5: Article Pipeline (HIGHEST)
Week 6: Rollout (MEDIUM)
```

---

## Critical Path: 17 Days

Cannot slip:
- Longtail expansion (3 days)
- Filtering (2 days)
- Subtopic generation (2 days)
- Article pipeline (3 days)

---

## Top 8 Risks

1. Bad keywords (SEO damage) - Medium
2. API limits (Workflow stalls) - High
3. Agent hallucinations (Trust loss) - Medium
4. Scope creep (Timeline delay) - High
5. Data corruption (System failure) - Low
6. User confusion (Adoption drop) - Medium
7. Feature flag bugs (Partial outage) - Low
8. Inngest failure (No articles) - Medium

---

## Feature Flags (Enable in Sequence)

Week 1: `enable_legacy_workflow` (default: true)
Week 2: `enable_icp`, `enable_competitors`
Week 3: `enable_seeds`, `enable_longtails`, `enable_filtering`
Week 4: `enable_subtopics`, `enable_approval`
Week 5: `enable_primary_workflow`

---

## Hard Gates (PM MUST ENFORCE)

| Gate | Blocks |
|------|--------|
| No ICP | Any keyword generation |
| No competitors | Seed keywords |
| No seed approval | Longtails |
| No longtails | Subtopics |
| No subtopic approval | Articles |

---

## Rollback Procedure

Time: < 5 minutes (feature flags only)

Disable flags in reverse order, then enable `enable_legacy_workflow`.

---

## Status Vocabulary (Standardized)

```
generated    - System created
filtered     - System filtered
approved     - Human approved
rejected     - Human rejected
queued       - Waiting in queue
generating   - Currently processing
completed    - Successfully finished
failed       - Error during processing
archived     - Removed from workflow
```

### 2026-04-17 — Tailwind canonical class fixes applied

- Files modified: infin8content/app/dashboard/articles/articles-client.tsx, infin8content/components/dashboard/sidebar-navigation.tsx
- Changes applied: canonicalized Tailwind utility classes to use design tokens and canonical forms (e.g. `h-[2px]` → `h-0.5`, `max-w-[200px]` → `max-w-50`, `gap-[18px]` → `gap-4.5`, replaced raw hex colors with token names like `text-text-primary` and `bg-warning/10`).
- Git: these edits are committed on branch `test-main-all` (commit `a083416c`) and pushed to `origin`. PR #458 (test-main-all → main) is open for CI and review.

## Next Steps

1. Merge to test-main-all
2. Create PR to main
3. Engineering begins Week 1

## 2026-03-17: Recent Engineering Updates

- **Internal linking implemented:** Added an idempotent internal-link injection step to the article generation pipeline. Files added: `lib/services/article-generation/internal-linking-service.ts`, `lib/inngest/functions/crawl-website-links.ts`.
- **Pipeline patched:** `lib/inngest/functions/generate-article.ts` now runs `inject-internal-links` immediately before `assemble-article` when `generationConfig.internal_links` is enabled.
- **Onboarding trigger:** `app/api/onboarding/business/route.ts` emits `organization/website.url.saved` to kick off crawls.
- **Inngest registration:** `app/api/inngest/route.ts` registered the crawl worker.
- **Branch & deploy steps:** Preparing changes on branch `test-main-all`; will commit, push, and open a PR to `main` for CI validation and integration testing.

Next actions: run integration smoke tests for the injection step and add unit tests for injection edge cases.

### Recent Engineering Updates (2026-03-18)

- `content-writing-agent.ts`: Replaced boolean interpolation for `add_cta` with a conditional natural-language CTA instruction. This enforces whether to include a single-sentence CTA or not based on `generationConfig.add_cta`.
- `convertMarkdownToHtml()`: Fixed link placeholder restoration to directly emit safe `<a>` tags and moved bold/italic processing before blockquote handling to correctly render inline emphasis inside blockquotes.
- `content-writing-agent.ts`: Restored list-handling logic after accidental corruption and removed stray prompt injection that appeared inside the markdown-to-HTML pipeline.
- `generate-article.ts`: Added defensive casts for schema/SEO step payloads to avoid a TypeScript object-shape error; `mark-completed` logic was hardened to re-check status and return idempotently when another worker completed the article.
- Article assembler: `slug` and `org_website_url` are now forwarded into final markdown builder so canonical article URLs and copy-link behavior are available.
- Inngest pipeline: `internal-linking` step inserted after geo/aero enrichment and before assembly (idempotent call).
- Validation: `tsc --noEmit` now passes after these edits. Vitest: unit tests for the article services folder were not present; full test-suite still reports environment-dependent failures (integration server not running). See CI run for details.

Next immediate steps:
- Push these edits to `test-main-all` and open a PR to `main` so CI can run the full integration suite.
- Add focused unit tests for `content-writing-agent` and the internal-linking step (optional fast follow-up).

### 2026-04-19 — Quick Dev Session: Test Fixes & Branch Push

- **Summary:** Performed a targeted test-fix pass addressing auth route tests and the Stripe webhook suite. Resolved mocking issues for `createServiceRoleClient` and Stripe SDK calls (`invoices.listLineItems`, `subscriptions.retrieve`), and adjusted Supabase query mocks from `.single()` to `.limit(1)` where the route uses `.limit(1)`.
- **Files fixed (tests):**
  - `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.test.ts` (10/10)
  - `app/api/auth/login/route.test.ts`
  - `app/api/auth/register/route.test.ts`
  - `app/api/auth/verify-otp/route.test.ts`
  - `app/api/organizations/create/route.test.ts`
- **Result:** Local full-suite run reported 0 failing files after fixes.
- **Branch work:** Created branch `test-main-all`, updated sprint docs and this scratchpad, committed changes, and pushed to `origin/test-main-all`.
- **Next:** Open PR from `test-main-all` → `main` so CI can run on remote; request reviewer when ready.
