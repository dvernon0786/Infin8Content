## Technique Selection

**Approach:** Progressive Technique Flow
**Journey Design:** Systematic development from exploration to action

**Progressive Techniques:**

- **Phase 1 - Exploration:** What If Scenarios + Cross-Pollination for maximum idea generation across all product areas
- **Phase 2 - Pattern Recognition:** Morphological Analysis for systematically organizing insights and finding optimal combinations
- **Phase 3 - Development:** SCAMPER Method for refining and improving each module through 7 creative lenses
- **Phase 4 - Action Planning:** Decision Tree Mapping + Failure Analysis for implementation planning and risk mitigation

**Journey Rationale:** Comprehensive product exploration requires starting with wild possibilities (What If + Cross-Pollination), then systematically organizing insights (Morphological Analysis), refining concepts through proven improvement frameworks (SCAMPER), and finally creating actionable implementation plans with risk awareness (Decision Trees + Failure Analysis).
