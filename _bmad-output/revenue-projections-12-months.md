- **Blended Average: $80**

**CAC by Month:**
- Months 1-3: $100 (higher paid ad spend for initial traction)

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Assumptions (aligned with PRD):**
- Average customer lifetime: 24 months
- Monthly churn rate: 4.2% (translates to 24-month retention)
- Blended ARPU: $141/month (as per PRD)
- Gross margin: 55%

**LTV Calculation:**
- Average revenue per customer: $141/month
- Gross profit per customer: $141 × 55% = $77.55/month

- With expansion: $5,200 LTV ÷ $80 CAC = **65:1**
- PRD target: >10:1
- **Our ratio exceeds PRD target by 2-6x**

**Payback Period:**
- Months to recover CAC: $80 ÷ $77.55 = **1.03 months**
- PRD target: <12 months
- **Our payback is 12x faster than PRD target**

**Gross Margin:**
- Month 1-3: 45% (early optimization phase)
- Month 4-6: 50% (scaling efficiencies)
