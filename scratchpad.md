- **Focused Security Fixes Created:** ✅ TARGETED SECURITY APPROACH - Created focused security migration addressing specific Supabase linter issues: Function Search Path Mutable (SET search_path = ''), Security Definer View (SECURITY INVOKER), RLS Disabled (enable RLS on sync_log), RLS Always True (restrictive webhook policy) (2026-01-13 21:34:00 UTC)
- **Focused Security Dependencies Fixed:** ✅ TRIGGER DEPENDENCY HANDLING - Fixed trigger dependencies in focused security migration by dropping triggers first for sync_article_status_to_progress and sync_article_status_to_progress_logged functions, then recreating both functions and triggers with proper search_path = '' security (2026-01-13 21:44:00 UTC)
