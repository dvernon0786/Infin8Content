6. [x] Implement API cost tracking per section ($0.00 for free models)
7. [x] Add error handling with exponential backoff retry logic
8. [x] Write comprehensive tests (unit, integration, E2E)

**Code Review Status:**
- **Review Date:** 2026-01-08
- **Initial Issues Found:** 8 issues (2 Critical, 4 High, 2 Medium)
- **Issues Fixed:** All 8 issues resolved
- **Re-Review Status:** ✅ APPROVED - All blocking issues resolved
- **Tests:** All passing (16 unit + integration + E2E tests)

**Code Review Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ **CRITICAL:** Fixed `formatCitationsForMarkdown()` to actually insert in-text citations naturally into content (was only adding reference list)
- ✅ **CRITICAL:** Moved quality validation to run AFTER citation integration so metrics reflect final content
- ✅ **CRITICAL:** Fixed quality retry logic to regenerate, re-integrate citations, and re-validate on final content
- ✅ **HIGH:** Updated `FREE_MODELS` list to use `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free` as primary model
- ✅ **HIGH:** Removed `nvidia/nemotron-3-demo-70b` (invalid model ID) and `tns-standard/tns-standard-8-7.5-chimera`
- ✅ **HIGH:** Enhanced error handling to detect 400 errors for invalid models and trigger fallback
- ✅ **MEDIUM:** Removed SERP analysis mentions from prompt (Story 4a-4 is optional)
- ✅ **MEDIUM:** Created missing integration tests (`tests/integration/article-generation/openrouter-content-generation.test.ts`)
- ✅ **MEDIUM:** Created missing E2E tests (`tests/e2e/article-generation/content-generation.spec.ts`)
- ✅ **MEDIUM:** Updated unit tests to reflect new 2-model list instead of 3 models

**Files Created/Modified:**
- **New Files:**
  - `infin8content/lib/services/openrouter/openrouter-client.ts` - OpenRouter API service client
  - `infin8content/lib/utils/content-quality.ts` - Content quality validation utilities
  - `infin8content/tests/services/openrouter-client.test.ts` - Unit tests (16 tests)
  - `infin8content/tests/integration/article-generation/openrouter-content-generation.test.ts` - Integration tests
  - `infin8content/tests/e2e/article-generation/content-generation.spec.ts` - E2E tests
- **Modified Files:**
  - `infin8content/lib/services/article-generation/section-processor.ts` - Integrated OpenRouter, quality validation (after citations), citation integration
  - `infin8content/lib/utils/citation-formatter.ts` - Fixed to insert in-text citations naturally
  - `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/4a-5-llm-content-generation-with-openrouter-integration.md` - Updated with fixes
  - `_bmad-output/sprint-status.yaml` - Updated story status to "review"

**Key Technical Decisions:**
1. **Model Selection:** Primary: `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free` (70B, 128K context), Backup: `meta-llama/llama-3bmo-v1-turbo`
2. **Quality Validation Order:** Citations integrated FIRST, then quality validation on final content
3. **Readability Calculator:** Custom Flesch-Kincaid implementation (no external dependencies)
4. **Error Handling:** Enhanced 400 error detection for invalid models with automatic fallback
5. **Citation Integration:** Natural insertion at sentence/paragraph breaks, not just at end

**Test Results:**
- **Unit Tests:** 16/16 passing (API authentication, model selection, retry logic, error handling, fallback chain)
- **Integration Tests:** All passing (Full flow: section → OpenRouter → quality → citation → cost tracking)
- **E2E Tests:** All passing (Article generation UI, content display, citation inclusion)

**Acceptance Criteria Status:**
- ✅ AC 1: OpenRouter API integration with model selection and fallback - IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ AC 2: Content generation per section with comprehensive prompt - IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ AC 3: Quality validation (word count, citations, headings, keyword, readability) - IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ AC 4: Citation integration (natural in-text + reference list) - IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ AC 5: API cost tracking ($0.00 per section) - IMPLEMENTED
