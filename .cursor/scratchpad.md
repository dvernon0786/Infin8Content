# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

User requested to install BMAD Method and initialize workflow tracking for the Infin8Content project.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Successfully installed BMAD Method v6.0.0-alpha.19
  - Core installed
  - BMB (BMad Builder) module installed
  - BMM (BMad Method) module installed
  - 41 workflows, 11 agents, 4 tasks, 1 tool configured
  - Installation path: `/home/dghost/Infin8Content/_bmad`
  
- ✅ Completed workflow-init workflow (YOLO mode)
  - Scanned for existing work (CLEAN state detected)
  - Confirmed project name: Infin8Content
  - Selected track: BMad Method (greenfield)
  - Discovery workflows: Brainstorm + Product Brief (recommended)
  - Generated workflow tracking file: `_bmad-output/bmm-workflow-status.yaml`

### Current Task
✅ **COMPLETED:** Product Brief Creation Workflow (2025-12-20)
- All 6 steps completed successfully
- Document: `_bmad-output/analysis/product-brief-Infin8Content-2025-12-18.md`
- Product Brief validated and aligned with comprehensive product specification
- Next workflow: PRD (create-prd) recommended

### Scan Results
**Project State: CLEAN** - No existing BMM artifacts or codebase detected
- No PRD, epics, architecture, or other BMM artifacts found
- No source code or package.json found
- Output folder `_bmad-output` does not exist yet
- Only BMAD framework files present (freshly installed)

## Project Status Board

- [x] Complete workflow-init setup
- [x] Determine project track (Method/Enterprise) - Selected: BMad Method
- [x] Select discovery workflows - Brainstorm + Product Brief recommended
- [x] Generate workflow tracking file - Created at _bmad-output/bmm-workflow-status.yaml
- [x] Activate analyst agent and start Product Brief workflow
- [x] Initialize product brief document (Step 1 complete)
- [ ] Complete product vision discovery (Step 2 in progress)
- [ ] Complete target user discovery (Step 3)
- [ ] Complete remaining product brief steps

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

✅ **Product Brief Workflow Started!**

**Current Progress:**
- Analyst agent (Mary) activated successfully
- Product Brief workflow initialized
- Document created: `_bmad-output/analysis/product-brief-Infin8Content-2025-12-18.md`

**Product Vision Discovery (Step 2) - Key Insights Captured:**

**Problem Statement:**
- Content creators don't struggle with ideas - they struggle with execution at scale
- Three core problems: consistency (unsustainable), time cost (disproportionate), format replication (hard to do reliably)

**Target Users:**
- Solopreneurs and founders building personal brands
- Coaches, consultants, and educators
- Small businesses relying on organic growth
- Agencies producing content for multiple clients

**Impact & Winning Conditions:**
- Current: 5-15 hours/week creating content
- Desired: Under 1 hour/week reviewing and approving
- Winning = leverage: content goes out daily, one input → 10-30 outputs, presence across all platforms

**Core Value Proposition:**
- Not another content tool - a content creation and posting engine
- Removes execution friction entirely
- One input → system handles creation, remixing, formatting, scheduling, publishing

**Awaiting User Input:**
- Competitive landscape analysis (what solutions exist, where they fall short)
- Solution differentiators (what makes Infin8Content unique)
- Unfair advantage details
- Why now is the right time

**Next:** Continue Step 2 vision discovery to complete competitive analysis and solution positioning before moving to Step 3 (target user discovery).

## Lessons

- BMAD Method successfully installed with npx command
- Installation created `_bmad` directory with all framework files
- Project is in CLEAN state, ready for fresh start
- Workflow-init creates structured tracking file at `_bmad-output/bmm-workflow-status.yaml`
- YOLO mode completes workflow with sensible defaults (greenfield + BMad Method track)
- BMad Method track includes: Discovery → Planning (PRD+UX) → Solutioning (Architecture+Epics) → Implementation
- Workflow tracking file contains complete path with all phases and workflow commands
- Next workflow should be brainstorming or product-brief (optional discovery), or jump to PRD if ready
- Product Brief workflow uses step-file architecture with strict sequential execution
- Each step must be completed before loading the next step file
- Frontmatter tracks `stepsCompleted` array for workflow state management
- Analyst agent facilitates collaborative discovery, not content generation without user input
- Product Brief workflow discovered: problem space, target users, impact, and value proposition
