## Lessons

- BMAD Method successfully installed with npx command
- Installation created `_bmad` directory with all framework files
- Project is in CLEAN state, ready for fresh start
- Workflow-init creates structured tracking file at `_bmad-output/bmm-workflow-status.yaml`
- YOLO mode completes workflow with sensible defaults (greenfield + BMad Method track)
- BMad Method track includes: Discovery → Planning (PRD+UX) → Solutioning (Architecture+Epics) → Implementation
- Workflow tracking file contains complete path with all phases and workflow commands
- Product Brief workflow uses step-file architecture with strict sequential execution
- Each step must be completed before loading the next step file
- Frontmatter tracks `stepsCompleted` array for workflow state management
- Analyst agent facilitates collaborative discovery, not content generation without user input
- Party Mode workflow enables multi-agent validation and feedback gathering
- Product Brief validation: Always cross-reference against comprehensive specifications to ensure completeness
- When validating documents, add missing sections systematically: Feature Catalog, User Journeys, Technical Architecture, Business Model, Competitive Analysis
- Persona details should match specification exactly (e.g., Sarah: 8 employees, 20 clients, not 15 employees, 25 clients)
- Business impact calculations must align with specification (e.g., Sarah's ROI: 66×, not 1,900%)
- Product Brief completion: Update workflow status file and scratchpad to reflect completion
- Next workflow after Product Brief: PRD (Product Requirements Document) for detailed requirements
- Market Research workflow: Comprehensive research covering customer insights, competitive landscape, market size, and technical validation
- Research validation: Always include validation report with confidence levels and required next steps
- Critical gaps identified: Primary customer research, competitor feature verification, technical prototype needed before full build
- Recommended approach: Validation-first (4 weeks) before committing to full 16-week build
- Client email creation: Focus on non-technical language, value proposition, and concrete ROI examples
- Development breakdown: Include hours, team composition, cost ranges, and timeline milestones for transparency
- Email structure: Problem → Solution → Benefits → Investment → Vision → Next Steps
