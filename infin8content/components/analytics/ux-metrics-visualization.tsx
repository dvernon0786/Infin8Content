/**
 * UX Metrics Visualization Component - DISABLED
 * 
 * This component has been disabled due to missing charting library dependencies
 * that are preventing the build from succeeding. The component imports
 * chart components like ResponsiveContainer, LineChart, BarChart, RePieChart
 * which are not available in the current UI component library.
 * 
 * The functionality can be re-enabled when the appropriate charting library
 * is added to dependencies or an alternative visualization solution is implemented.
