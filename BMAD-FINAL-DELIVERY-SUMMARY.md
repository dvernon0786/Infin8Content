## Architecture Locked

### 9-Step Workflow (IMMUTABLE)

```
STEP 0  Auth + Org exists
STEP 1  ICP generation (Perplexity)
STEP 2  Competitor analysis (URLs)
STEP 3  Seed keywords (3 per competitor)
STEP 4  Longtail expansion (4 DataForSEO methods)
STEP 5  Automated filtering
STEP 6  Topic clustering (hub → spoke)
STEP 7  Subtopic generation
STEP 8  Human approval
STEP 9  Article generation (agents)
```

### 5 Hard Gates (PM MUST ENFORCE)

| Gate | Blocks |
|------|--------|
| No ICP | Any keyword generation |
| No competitors | Seed keywords |
| No seed approval | Longtails |
| No longtails | Subtopics |
| No subtopic approval | Articles |

### 9 Feature Flags (Enable in Sequence)

Week 1: `enable_legacy_workflow` (default: true)  
Week 2: `enable_icp`, `enable_competitors`  
Week 3: `enable_seeds`, `enable_longtails`, `enable_filtering`  
Week 4: `enable_subtopics`, `enable_approval`  
Week 5: `enable_primary_workflow`

## Top 8 Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Bad keywords | SEO damage | Medium | Hard filters + ICP gate |
| API limits | Workflow stalls | High | Queue + retry + cache |
| Agent hallucinations | Trust loss | Medium | Section-scoped research |
| Scope creep | Timeline delay | High | Architecture locked |
| Data corruption | System failure | Low | Additive-only schema |
| User confusion | Adoption drop | Medium | Status-gated UI |
| Feature flag bugs | Partial outage | Low | System tested |
| Inngest failure | No articles | Medium | Monitoring + fallback |

## PM Audit Framework

### Week 1 PR Review Process

1. **PR 1 (Database Foundations)** - Schema correctness, migration safety
2. **PR 2 (Feature Flags)** - All 9 flags, resolution order
3. **PR 3 (Hard Gates)** - All 5 gates, server-side enforcement (MOST IMPORTANT)
4. **PR 4 (RLS & Data Safety)** - Org isolation, cross-org denial
5. **PR 5 (Status Vocabulary)** - Canonical verbs only, type safety

### PM Authority

- ✅ PM has veto power on all PRs
- ✅ Passing tests ≠ passing BMAD
- ✅ Line-by-line audit checklist provided
