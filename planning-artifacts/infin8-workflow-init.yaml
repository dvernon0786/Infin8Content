notes: |
  This is a mature project with extensive existing functionality.
  Focus on integration with existing patterns and maintaining backward compatibility.
  Current priority areas: Intent Engine completion, workflow orchestration, onboarding system.
  
  Key architectural patterns to follow:
  - Intent Engine workflow steps with proper state management
  - Organization isolation via RLS policies
  - Audit logging for compliance
  - Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
  - Deterministic article generation pipeline
