notes: |
  This is a production-ready platform with zero-legacy FSM architecture.
  Focus on maintaining system stability while adding new features.
  Current priority areas: Epic 38 completion, production optimization, performance monitoring.
  
  Key architectural patterns to follow:
  - Zero-legacy FSM state transitions only
  - Organization isolation via RLS policies
  - Comprehensive audit logging for compliance
  - Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
  - Deterministic article generation pipeline
  - Atomic workflow guards for race safety
  
  Production considerations:
  - No legacy field references (status, current_step, step_*_completed_at)
  - All state changes through WorkflowFSM.transition()
  - Explicit field selection in database queries
  - Type-safe enum state validation

recommended_next_workflows:
  - For new features: "/dev-story" or "/module-builder"
  - For Epic 38: "/dev" with story context
  - For system analysis: "/source-tree-analysis"
  - For documentation: "/document-project"
  - For code review: "/code-review"
