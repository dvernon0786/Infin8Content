# BMAD Brownfield Primary Content Workflow - PM Phase Scratchpad

**Date:** 2026-01-30  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE & BMAD-CLEAN  
**Phase:** Ready for Engineering

**Sync (2026-04-18):** Docs synchronized for branch `docs/scratchpad-sync` (source: `origin/test-main-all`). See central `scratchpad.md` for full commit refs and next steps.

**Update (2026-04-18):** Outstand social publishing integration complete. Branch `test-main-all`. Backend: 9 files (migration, Outstand client, caption generator, Inngest functions, API routes, webhook). Frontend: 3 new components (`SocialPublishModal`, `PublishToSocialButton`, `SocialAnalytics`). Article detail page patched. `tsc --noEmit` exits 0. Epic 5 story `5-7-social-media-sharing-integration` now implementable. `__tests__/tsconfig.json` `ignoreDeprecations` updated to `"6.0"`.

**Update (2026-04-16):** Epic 12 — Onboarding & Feature Discovery completed (branch `feat/epic-12-onboarding-discovery`, PR #458)

**Update (2026-04-16):** Marketing site refactor: header/footer added and design-system fixes applied. Commits: `fc70de23`, `6c105c08`, `ab868627`. Changes pushed to `test-main-all`; remote `main` created from it and points to the same commit (no PR diff).

## Surgical Corrections Applied

### 1. Keywords Hierarchy (BMAD-CLEAN)
**Before:** Implicit polymorphism with `seed_keyword_id` + `keyword_type`  
**After:** Explicit hierarchy with `keyword_level` + `parent_keyword_id`

```sql
keyword_level TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (keyword_level IN ('seed', 'longtail'))
parent_keyword_id UUID REFERENCES keywords(id)

-- Constraint prevents invalid chains
ALTER TABLE keywords ADD CONSTRAINT valid_keyword_hierarchy CHECK (
  (keyword_level = 'seed' AND parent_keyword_id IS NULL) OR
  (keyword_level = 'longtail' AND parent_keyword_id IS NOT NULL)
);
```

### 2. blog_inputs Scope (BMAD-CLEAN)
**Before:** Generic bucket for workflow artifacts  
**After:** Config-only organization settings

```sql
-- blog_inputs is READ-ONLY ORG CONFIG
writing_tone TEXT
target_audience TEXT
brand_voice_guidelines TEXT
style_examples JSONB
excluded_topics JSONB
preferred_sources JSONB

-- Workflow artifacts go in:
-- - competitors
-- - keywords
-- - keywords.subtopics
-- - articles
```

### 3. Status Vocabulary (STANDARDIZED)
**Before:** Mixed verbs (generated, ranked, selected, approved, etc.)  
**After:** Standardized vocabulary across all layers

```
System produced → generated
System filtered → filtered
System completed → completed
Human decision → approved / rejected
Execution queued → queued
Execution running → generating
Execution finished → completed
Execution failed → failed
Archived → archived
```

## Architectural Confirmations Verified

### ✅ 1. Subtopic Immutability (LOCKED)
- Approved subtopics cannot be modified
- Regeneration creates new subtopic with new ID
- Original remains in audit trail
- Database trigger enforces immutability

### ✅ 2. Onboarding vs Dashboard Boundary
- Onboarding = context only (ICP, competitors, seeds)
- Dashboard = intent + execution (longtails, subtopics, articles)
- UI blocks article generation until onboarding complete
- API returns 403 if ICP not generated

### ✅ 3. ICP Hard Gate
- ICP is mandatory and FIRST
- All downstream steps blocked until ICP exists
- UI prevents skipping
- API enforces 403 if ICP missing

### ✅ 4. URL-Driven Keyword Engine
- Competitor URLs are source of truth
- Keywords tied to competitor URLs
- Hub-and-spoke structure enforced
- SEO strategy is defensible

### ✅ 5. Agent Discipline
- Planner produces section-level research questions
- Research runs once per section
- Writer runs strictly sequentially
- Explicit prompt selection
- OpenRouter abstraction with cheapest-by-default
